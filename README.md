### How to contribute

To contribute a social media post to our channel is pretty simple - all you need is to create PR that would add one or more images (`png` or `jpg`) and optional text to the repo (please use `posts` folder).

Recommended approach is to add new directory with your name or nickname under the `posts` and images there. Optional text should be placed named exactly as your image but have `.txt` extension. Each image+text is a social media post. For example, adding `john_doe/01.png` and `john_doe/01.txt` would add social media post with image `01.png` and text `01.txt` to our social media queue.
